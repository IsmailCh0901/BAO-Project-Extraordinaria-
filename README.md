# BAO-Project-Extraordinaria-
Repository Structure Description for Schedule Optimization Problem Using Bioinspired Algorithms

This repository structure is organized to manage different bioinspired algorithms (GA and ACO) and their respective configurations, datasets, and results systematically.

A Google Collab link of the project is attached in order to facilitate code execution:
https://colab.research.google.com/drive/102iMOTvGnsjAuWj2xyNnBeRWupHt0LXd?usp=sharing

Make sure that you follow the specified instructions on the Google Collab so you can replicate the same results obtained.

Project Directory:

    

    1. GA Directory (Genetic Algorithm):

        -CSVs Optimization Directory: This directory stores CSV files generated during the optimization process.
        -CSVs Seeds Directory: This directory contains CSV files related to the different seeds used in the Genetic Algorithm.


    2. ACO Directory (Ant Colony Optimization):
        
        -CSVs Optimization Directory: This directory stores CSV files generated during the optimization process.
        -CSVs Seeds Directory: This directory contains CSV files related to the different seeds used in the ACO algorithm.
